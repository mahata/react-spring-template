# React Spring Template

This repository aims to be a template project for an app with Spring Boot (Kotlin) + React (TypeScript) combination.

You can run the Spring Boot app as follows:

```
$ cd server
$ ./gradlew bootRun 
```

You can run the React app as follows:

```
$ cd web
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

React app tries to call an API endpoint provided by Spring Boot. It's for demonstrating the capability of interoperability.
